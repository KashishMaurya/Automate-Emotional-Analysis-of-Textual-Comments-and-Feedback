# 🎭 Automated Emotional Analysis of Textual Comments and Feedback

This project focuses on **automating emotional analysis** of textual comments and feedback using NLP and deep learning techniques.  
It helps in identifying emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc., from user-generated text.

## 📌 Features

- Preprocessing of textual data (cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal).  
- Word frequency & emotion distribution analysis.  
- Model training for emotion classification.  
- Support for multiple emotions (customizable).  
- Easy-to-run notebook with Colab integration.

## ⚡ Requirements

If you want to run the notebook **locally**, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn
````

For **Google Colab**, all major dependencies will be installed automatically when running the notebook.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Click the **Open in Colab** button above.
2. Upload dataset if required (or mount Google Drive if dataset is large).
3. Run cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.
4. View charts and emotion prediction outputs.

## 📊 Example Outputs

* Word frequency charts of dataset.
* Distribution of text lengths by emotion.
* Accuracy/Confusion Matrix for the classifier.
* Emotion predictions for custom text input.

---

## 🌍 Applications

* Customer feedback analysis.
* Social media monitoring.
* Sentiment/emotion-aware chatbots.
* Opinion mining in reviews.
